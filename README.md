This repository contains the HTML, CSS and Javascript of the presentation done during :
Forum Acusticum 2023 (Sept. 11-15 2023, Torino, Italy)
with
Title : Live coding of an nteractive web application
Author : Luc Jaouen (Matelys)
in session : A22-02, Interactive media or demonstrations for lectures and laboratory


During this presentation, I propose to show how to code, from scratch, a simple interactive web page describing an acoustic concept.
Examples of such webpages are discussed in L. Jaouen and O. Robin, "Explaining and teaching acoustics through comics, interactive web pages, and video games", J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 152 (2), pp. 745-752, 2022, https://doi.org/10.1121/10.0013011
and are available at: https://apmr.matelys.com/BasicsAcoustics/1A_EN/

For this presentation, a basic HTML will be used. 
This template can be used to easily create new interactive pages.
 
The full code for this interactive web application is available at https://github.com/ljaouen/FA2023
