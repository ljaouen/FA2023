This repository contains the HTML, CSS and Javascript of the presentation done during :
Forum Acusticum 2023 (Sept. 11-15 2023, Torino, Italy)
with
Title : Live coding of a web interactive application
Author : Luc Jaouen (Matelys)
in session : A22-02, Interactive media or demonstrations for lectures and laboratory


During this presentation, I propose to show how to code, from scratch, a simple interactive web page describing an acoustic concept.
Examples of such webpages are discussed in L. Jaouen and O. Robin, "Explaining and teaching acoustics through comics, interactive web pages, and video games", J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 152 (2), pp. 745-752, 2022, https://doi.org/10.1121/10.0013011
and are available at: https://apmr.matelys.com/BasicsAcoustics/1A_EN/

For this presentation, a basic HTML + responsive CSS template will be used together with Bret Victor's "Tangle" Javascript library for interactivity (see http://worrydream.com/Tangle/guide.html). This template can be used to easily create new interactive pages.
 
The full code for this interactive web application is available at https://github.com/ljaouen/FA2023
