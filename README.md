This repository contains the HTML, CSS and Javascript of the presentation done during 
Forum Acusticum 2023 (Sept. 11-15 2023, Torino, Italy):
Live coding of an interactive web application by Luc Jaouen (Matelys) in session : A22-02, Interactive media or demonstrations for lectures and laboratory.


During this presentation, I propose to show how to code, from scratch, a simple interactive web page describing an acoustic concept.
Examples of such webpages are discussed in L. Jaouen and O. Robin, "Explaining and teaching acoustics through comics, interactive web pages, and video games", J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 152 (2), pp. 745-752, 2022, https://doi.org/10.1121/10.0013011
and are available at: https://apmr.matelys.com/BasicsAcoustics/1A_EN/

For this presentation, a basic HTML will be used. 
This template can be used to easily create new interactive pages.
